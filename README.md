# Running Assistant

This application is for Runners whom would like to record their running activities on their iOS device, like on iPhone, iPod or iPad.

This project is just for a University course. I will not submit this to AppStore.

### Prerequisites

- Apple Computer or Laptop
- xCode IDE
- Apple iPhone (with USB cable, wireless install is not supported)

### Installing

Currently it is possible to install downloaded iOS applications via xCode with general free subscription

(Step guide will be provided later)
